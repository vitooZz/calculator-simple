Design Description:
Gradient Background:

The body background uses a soft gradient from dark to lighter shades (linear-gradient(45deg, #333, #555)), which adds depth and visual interest without overwhelming the main focus (the calculator). This effect gives a modern and sleek look.

Subtle Shadow on Sides:

The addition of a subtle shadow effect on both the left and right sides (::before pseudo-element) creates a more focused and highlighted area for the calculator. The shadow, combined with a transparent overlay, visually isolates the calculator from the background, making it stand out more clearly on the page.

Modern, Clean Design:

The calculator container (.calculator) has rounded corners and a soft box shadow that gives it a floating effect, enhancing the visual appeal. The dark color scheme and bold buttons make the calculator look modern and stylish, while the button animations (scale effect when pressed) provide a smooth, interactive feel.

Button Layout:

The button grid is simple and easy to read, using clear contrasts between button colors (light, dark, orange, green) to distinguish different functionalities like operations, numbers, and the equal sign.

The zero button spans two columns for better usability, maintaining a clean and balanced layout.

Responsive Design:

The design is responsive, adjusting appropriately to different screen sizes, particularly on mobile devices. The font size and padding are adjusted for smaller screens to ensure usability while maintaining the overall aesthetic.

Summary:
The visual enhancements make the calculator both functional and stylish, creating a balance between modern design and usability. The gradient background, subtle shadows, and interactive button effects improve the overall user experience, while the clean layout ensures that the calculator remains easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
